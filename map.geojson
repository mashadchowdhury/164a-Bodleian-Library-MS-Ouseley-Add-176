    "description":"In this image, we can see the lionhearted Rustam, the son of Zal, in a fierce battle with the Khaqan of Chin. Rustam is a ferocious warrior, being born to Zal and Rudabeh in a miraculous fashion, whose birth was accompanied by the appearance of the giant mystical creature Simurgh to help with the caesarean birth. Since the day he was born, he was known as the “lion cub”, and who more worthy to hold such a description than Rustam, the baby that grew into a boy within a week, and into a strong, young man within mere weeks. He was so strong that he was the only one able to stop and kill a white elephant that was causing a rampage in the royal palace. This is Rustam, the raging warrior.\n\nOn the other end, the Khan of Chin, also known as the King of China, was an enemy of Rustam and the Persians. He came to face Rustam with an enormous army of beautifully adorned war elephants. The Khan of Chin had many warriors and soldiers who tried to track down Rustam before, but they were not able to and were then vanquished in this battle. That is when Rustam came face-to-face with the Khan of Chin and the story unfolds…"},

    "description": "After a confrontation between Rustam and the Khan of Chin, Rustam was attacked by the Khan of Chin with a double-headed battle-dart aimed at chopping off Rustam’s head. However, in a twist of fate, Rustam retaliated and used his lasso to drag the Khan of Chin off his elephant by his neck. This all took place after a heated altercation between the two parties. This shows that Rustam desired to show his power through the use of his lasso, which he eventually did by pulling the great Khan of Chin off the elephant using nothing but his lasso. Rustam visibly has a sword on him, but he instead chooses to use his lasso to demonstrate his power, and to demonstrate that he is no normal leader.\n\nThe lasso also carries a deep symbolism, that Rustam is humiliating the Khan of Chin, as Rustam now has full control of the Khan’s body in his hands. Moreover, the lasso is a somewhat unusual and unique weapon as compared to a traditional sword and mastering the use of this weapon would take a lot of dedication from a committed warrior, like Rustam. This shows the adamance and determination from Rustam in battling the Khan of Chin."},

    "description":"From the face of the Khan of Chin, we can observe that the Khan of Chin looks terrified being dragged off the elephant, His face is full of fear, and we notice his desperation in trying to pull the lasso off his neck, but all without success. He looks clearly intimidated and frightened, which can be seen from his face structure. His eyes are full of terror and panic. It looks as if the Khan of Chin is remorseful and is fully aware of what is to happen if he is captured by Rustam and is, thus, trying to prevent his capture as much as he can.\n\nIn contrast to the Khan of Chin, Rustam looks much braver and more courageous and looks as if he is the one in control of the situation. Unlike the helpless Khan of Chin, Rustam’s face looks confident and fearless, from which we can conclude who the clear winner of this battle is. Rustam looks like a true warrior whereas the Khan of Chin looks like a scared so-called King. It is as if Rustam is boasting to the Khan of Chin that he is messing with the wrong person, and that this is the consequence of those who dare to mess with the great Rustam."},

    "description":"The cheetah on the helmet of Rustam signifies the bravery and the valour of Rustam. From a young age, Rustam was known as the “lion’s cub”, a description he truly lived up to throughout his life. This battle is the most accurate display of his fearless qualities, which is why the illustrator uses this opportunity to paint Rustam’s helmet with a realistic depiction of a cheetah.\n\nThe cheetah, as an animal, signifies courage, strength, and speed, qualities which are all evident and present in the persona of Rustam. The cheetah is a predator which waits patiently for the prey to be in its range and, and then when it gets its chance and the time is right, it starts its chase and pounces on its prey with speed and force. It is as if the author is telling us that Rustam, just like the cheetah, waited for the perfect moment, when the Khan of Chin was fully in his vision and range and when he was in his weakest state without any of his soldiers to defend him, to catch him and to hunt him down. The cheetah also looks like it is looking straight at the Khan of Chin, which gives us the impression that Rustam has an extra set of eyes, four furious eyes looking straight at the petrified soul of the Khan of Chin."},

    "description": "Moreover, we can also witness that there are two archers on the elephant with their bows in full draw, which shows that they are fully ready to defend the Khan of Chin and shoot in a moment’s notice. Unlike the Khan of Chin, these archers look much less frightened and instead much more courageous. They have their eyes set on and their bows locked on Rustam. They are about to shoot at any moment to defend their beloved, helpless King.\n\nWe can also observe that the archers are wearing helmets that look vastly different from the helmets of Rustam and other warriors in the Shahnameh. These helmets are black in colour, and pointy at the top in shape. We could assume that this is the style of helmets that originate from China, and since these warriors are from that region, this is the style of helmets that is uniform in armies that come from that part of the world. The illustrator is demonstrating to the audience that these were foreign people who came from an unfamiliar land with different customs and clothing, in contrast to the Persian culture that Rustam, along with the audience during the time of the writing of Shahnameh, were part of and were, thus, used to."},

    "description": "Regarding the animals in this picture, we notice that the horse is startled during this encounter whereas the elephant is more monotonous. The reasons for this could be manifold and would require some historical understanding of the role of the elephant and the horse during wars. During the Battle of Ipsus, it is said that \"the ancient sources repeatedly emphasize the effect of elephants on horses, which are alarmed by the smell and noise of elephants and are loath to approach them. [During the battle] Demetrius would not have been able to take his horses through the line of elephants, nor manoeuvre around such a large quantity of elephants.\" (Battle of Ipsus, Wikipedia).\n\nFrom this excerpt, we understand that during the Battle of Ipsus, which was a battle in 300BC in modern-day Turkey, the elephants were used as a strategic move by an army to scare off the horses of the opposing army. The horses feel an intense dislike for the smell and noise of elephants. This could explain why the horse looks stunned in this picture.\n\nAnother reason for this contrast in reactions could be because the horse has a full view of the Khan of Chin being pulled off by the lasso, a view which startles the horse, whereas the elephant is on the ground and has a very limited view on the events taking place, especially since the Khan is sitting on the elephant itself, and it is therefore calmer and more monotonous."},

    "description": "On the bottom left side of this page, we see that the image overflows outside the margin, and this is to demonstrate to the audience the magnitude of this event and that this is “too huge of an event to be put in a limited illustration”. The artist uses the tool of drawing outside the margin to show the emphasis and importance of this story, and to show that this encounter was no normal encounter.\n\nThere is also a wide range of colour schemes used in this illustration: from the red and green bows of the archers, to the ornate, orange carriage on the elephant’s back (the howdah). We also notice the bright red saddle on Rustam’s horse, the golden armour on Rustam’s body, and the shades of blue on the clothing of all the characters in this image. The illustrator intentionally uses all these colour schemes to highlight the power and passion present in this image. Just how the colours are more diversified and intensified, the event painted is accordingly more emphasized and given more weight to.\n\nFurthermore, there is a blue sky depicted in the background, which shows us that this event is taking place in the daytime. The hills in the backdrop show us that this is in a hilly terrain, which could be assumed to mean that this is taking place in a countryside setting."},
